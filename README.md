A Directory to simulate AI learning cars using NEAT (python library)
includes a dashboard with visualization of the rays used, neural network, and the fitness of the generation
The way the library works is that each generation builds upon the best car of the last generation with some random genetical mutations (like natural selection)

To Run:
run the file "main.py" and press "f" for fast mode, "r" to restart the learning and the different numbers to change tracks.

sometimes, the ai takes longer and sometimes shorter to be completely "trained" so you might want to restart or change maps to see progression

##AI NOTE:
Most of the code was generated by ME but a couple of areas (old versions of core.py, main() - only calling all the methods, and some of the math/formatting) were done by AI. 
I am pretty sure that this falls well well below the 1/5 of my code but just wanted clarify that if there was 1-2 large copy paste, it was probably AI.
