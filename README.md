A Directory to simulate AI learning cars using NEAT (python library)
includes a dashboard with visualization of the rays used, neural network, and the fitness of the generation
The way the library works is that each generation builds upon the best car of the last generation with some random genetical mutations (like natural selection)

To Run:
run the file "main.py" and press "f" for fast mode, "r" to restart the learning and the different numbers to change tracks.

sometimes, the ai takes longer and sometimes shorter to be completely "trained" so you might want to restart or change maps to see progression

the base values for neat and the track paths were generated by ai (just the basic parameters and some tracks to test the cars on). some of the equations were made with tweaking values and some were created by ai.
